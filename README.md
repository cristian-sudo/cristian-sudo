## 🌟 Fun Facts & Hobbies

When I'm not busy coding, you might find me at the gym or running through the streets of London. Fitness is my secret weapon for strategic planning and time management—who knew lifting weights could improve your code? 🎨 I'm also an art enthusiast, which influences my organizational skills and sartorial choices (because who doesn't love a well-styled codebase?).
